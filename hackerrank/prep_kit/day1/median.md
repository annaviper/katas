The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of
elements occur after it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median?

# Example
`arr = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]`. 
The sorted array `arr' = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
The middle element and the median is 3.
